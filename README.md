OTHER TERMINAL ANIMATIONS
-------------------------

Here are some other interesting terminal animations I've found over the years:

* [CMatrix](http://www.asty.org/cmatrix/)
* [snowjob.js](https://gist.github.com/sontek/1505483) (I've been running this as 'snowfall', so I'm not sure if this is where I originally found it)
* [Star Wars Episode IV](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20060406084728559)
